Problem 15
==========

Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to
the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?

Solution
--------

In an $n \times m$ grid, the possible paths are strings with the following
characteristics:

  * Their length is $n + m$.

  * Each character is either $r$ (right) or $d$ (down).

  * The number of $r$ characters is $n$ and the number of $d$ characters is $m$.

To build the set of paths, we can use the following procedure:

  * Each character can be chosen from a set with $n + m$ elements.

  * Since there are $n$ non-distinguishable elements of type $r$ and $m$
    non-distinguishable elements of type $r$, we have to remove identical
    strings generated by all the possible permutations of $r$ and $b$, which are
    respectively $n!$ and $m!$.

Hence, the number of these strings is:

$$ \frac{(n + m)}{n! m!} $$
