// The primes 3, 7, 109, and 673, are quite remarkable.  By taking any two
// primes and concatenating them in any order the result will always be prime.
// For example, taking 7 and 109, both 7109 and 1097 are prime.  The sum of
// these four primes, 792, represents the lowest sum for a set of four primes
// with this property.
//
// Find the lowest sum for a set of five primes for which any two primes
// concatenate to produce another prime.
